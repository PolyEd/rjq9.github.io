<h1>Why You Should Visit Planet Codex!</h1>
<h2>Planet Codex Travel is sponsored by Neutrino Niio Products, creating neutrino rifles, missiles, aircraft, and sporting goods since 2249. Without them, Codex would be a ruin infested with spiders. </h2>
<p>Planet Codex is one of the first habitable planets ever found! It is home to a variety of creatures, such as the man-eating spider and the Arcenic Fire Beetle.
  Although there is some danger, most of the planet is peaceful! Or at least it was until the man-eating spiders conquered the land. Please help, there isn't much time.
  Luckily, they OH GOD THEY ARE HERE! RUN... [signal lost]
  [Signal resumed.]
  Hello again! I am back! Oh, I'm fine. The spiders did cut off my arm and put me in solitary confinement for 2 weeks, but they have done worse. 
  Did I tell you the story of when my arms AND my legs fell of? I was 23 and had just gotten a job as a protector of the Great City. I thought that my neutrino rifle 88e-810 would protect me...
  The spiders ran at me with a force of a earthquake. I tried to shoot at them, but they deflected. Four of them reached me, and tried to rip my arms of...
  Hey leave me alone! I'm just trying to tell a story! I'm trying to consentrat... okay that's true, it might scare people away. The legs being ripped off was gruesome. Okay. 
  Ahem. I will now begin speaking.
