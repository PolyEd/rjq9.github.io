<h1>Why You Should Visit Planet Codex!</h1>
<h2>Planet Codex Travel is sponsored by Neutrino Niio Products, creating neutrino rifles, missiles, aircraft, and sporting goods since 2249. Without them, Codex would be a ruin infested with spiders. </h2>
<p>Planet Codex is one of the first habitable planets ever found! It is home to a variety of creatures, such as the man-eating spider and the Arcenic Fire Beetle. <br>
  Although there is some danger, most of the planet is peaceful! Or at least it was until the man-eating spiders conquered the land. Please help, there isn't much time. <br>
  Luckily, they OH GOD THEY ARE HERE! RUN... [signal lost] <br>
  [Signal resumed.] <br>
  Hello again! I am back! Oh, I'm fine. The spiders did cut off my arm and put me in solitary confinement for 2 weeks, but they have done worse. <br> 
  Did I tell you the story of when my arms AND my legs fell of? I was 23 and had just gotten a job as a protector of the Great City. I thought that my neutrino rifle 88e-810 would protect me... <br>
  The spiders ran at me with a force of a earthquake. I tried to shoot at them, but they deflected. Four of them reached me, and tried to rip my arms of... <br>
  Hey leave me alone! I'm just trying to tell a story! I'm trying to consentrat... okay that's true, it might scare people away. The legs being ripped off was gruesome. Okay. <br>
  Ahem. I will now begin speaking. 
  Welcome to Codex, everyone! Although there is some danger, Neutrino rifles will typically protect you. The example you saw before was when the person was using 88e-810. <br>
  Although it was once one of the best rifles, it has been phased out by the 90a1-884, which is far better at repelling spiders. You should be safe. Plus, Codex has many beautiful creatures!
  One such creature is Blobulum Trididanium, a species that included His Holiness Bob The Blob. <br>
  <img src="the_holiness_bob_the_blob.png" alt = "Bob The Blob's noble portrait."> <br>
  Note: Bob The Blob is not in past tense. Bob The Blob is immortal for as long as there is life, as it is life. Bob the Blob is the universe and life and everything. The error will be punished.</p>
  <h3>All hail Bob The Blob. </h3>
